## Google mirror

### Rio Olympic

The Google doodle and the Olympic special component works perfectly.  
Well, honesty, I myself was surprised when I first saw the doodle and component.  
They were not *PLANNED* to be supported, actually, there is not any code or settings for doodle or the component,  
nothing but just the builtin powerful generic rules.
